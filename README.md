# texter-server-client

This app was created for editing file on server to show how sockets work.

## How to use texter?

**_First of all, cd to program directory to keep access to all dependecies_**

**Do not forget to create `test.txt` file** or with filename specified in `settings.py` 
* To start server, run `server.py`
* To start client, run `main.py`

### Configuring
You can change `settings.py` and `logger.conf` to change filename, etc.
